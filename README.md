# Arsh Goyal's DSA Challenge 

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for Arsh Goyal's DSA Challenge! In this challenge, I've tackled seven Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions, from 6 different Companies. The solutions are implemented in C++ and cover a range of topics to enhance your problem-solving skills.

## Challenges Solved

## DAY--1

1. **Combination_Sum.cpp**
   - Problem Description: Given a set of candidate numbers and a target sum, find all unique combinations where the candidate numbers sum to the target.
   
2. **Combinations_in_a_Phone_Number.cpp**
   - Problem Description: Given a digit string, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent on a phone keypad.

3. **Find_Missing_And_Repeating.cpp**
   - Problem Description: Find both the repeating and the missing elements in an array of integers containing elements from 1 to N.

4. **Finding_Consecutive_Numbers_From_Data_Stream.cpp**
   - Problem Description: Design a data structure that supports adding new elements and finding if any three consecutive numbers exist in the structure.

5. **Map_of_HighestPeak.cpp**
   - Problem Description: Given a binary matrix where 0 represents water and 1 represents land, find the height of the tallest peak in the matrix.

6. **Minimize_the_Maximum_of_two_Array.cpp**
   - Problem Description: Given two arrays of integers, select elements from both arrays such that the maximum obtained sum of elements is minimized.

7. **Ways_to_Reach_End_After_K_Steps.cpp**
   - Problem Description: Given an array of integers representing the maximum number of steps that can be made forward from that element, determine the number of ways to reach the end of the array after exactly K steps.
